**__Financial Analysis Script__**

I successfully developed a Python script to analyze the financial records of a made up company. The dataset provided was named "budget_data.csv" and consisted of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

The objective was to create a Python script that would analyze the records and calculate the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, as well as the average of those changes.
4. The greatest increase in profits, including the corresponding date and amount, over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in profits, including the corresponding date and amount, over the entire period.
6. I successfully implemented the Python script to perform these calculations. The script printed the analysis directly to the terminal, providing comprehensive information on the financial records. 


**__Modernizing Vote-Counting Process__**

I was tasked with assisting a small, rural town in modernizing its vote-counting process. The objective was to streamline the process and enhance efficiency.

I was provided with a dataset named "election_data.csv," which consisted of three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." My goal was to create a Python script that would analyze the votes and calculate the following values:

The total number of votes cast.
1. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
2. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
3. The total number of votes each candidate won.
4. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
5. I successfully developed a Python script to accomplish these tasks. The script effectively analyzed the provided election data and calculated the required values. Furthermore, it printed the analysis directly to the terminal, ensuring clear visibility of the results. Additionally, the script exported a text file containing the analysis for further reference.
